          We live in a world where technology is advancing by the second. One facet of that change is enhanced communication. Across various platforms, we have never been more connected with the people in our lives and, more substantially, any stranger worldwide. 
          <br />
          <br />
          Although, at the same time, it feels like humans have never been more disconnected. Technology likes to promise solutions that make real life more effortless. Many people have found the opposite true and would agree that technology has complicated our lives. Because of the endless distractions, reality continues to be confusing and complicated. Thus, many people have turned to isolation from the world around them.

          <h2 className='my-10 text-[1.5rem]'>What is Allmanos?</h2>
          <p>Allmanos exists to bring people back together to serve one another for the flourishing of our neighborhoods, communities, and towns. 
          <br />
          <br />
          The Spanish word “manos” translates to the English word for “hands.” Communities need <i>all hands</i> serving one another to thrive. Allmanos is an “in real life” platform that propels humanitarian efforts that most technology has suffocated.

          <h2 className='my-10 text-[1.5rem]'>Why Use Allmanos?</h2>
          <p>You and I both want a social good - a sense that we are impacting our neighborhood. Often, it’s tough to figure out where to start. Who needs help? How could I support them? What skills could I use? 
          <br />
          <br />
          If you were going to serve your neighborhood, a few outlets are available to you, including churches, non-profits, work opportunities, local gatherings, and disaster relief efforts. These typically require you to be involved with the organization to serve or ad-hoc in crises. 
          <br />
          <br />
          Regardless of the source, you must seek out a service opportunity, inquire of the people involved, then sign up/commit if you are a candidate. Allmanos alleviates the burden of seeking out opportunities to serve and places them at your fingertips.

          <h2 className='my-10 text-[1.5rem]'>How Does Allmanos Work?</h2>
          <p>Allmanos is a real-time platform that provides up-to-date service opportunities in your area. There are no long-term commitments, no lengthy sign-up, and no ambiguity - just you stepping into your neighborly call in an instant. 
          <br />
          <br />
          Upon finding a service request, you can chat with your neighbor needing assistance and figure out how to best serve them.  
          <br />
          <br />
          People can set up groups called “communities” where users can request services and serve as a group. Communities can be public or private, but they are encouraged to be relevant to organizations in your neighborhood.
