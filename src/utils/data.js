Across various platforms, we have never been more connected with the people in our lives and, more substantially, any stranger worldwide. Although, at the same time, it feels like humans have never been more disconnected. Technology likes to promise solutions that make real life more effortless. Many people have found the opposite true and would agree that technology has complicated our lives. Because of the endless distractions, reality continues to be confusing and complicated. Thus, many people have turned to isolation from the world around them.`
