My NSS Front-End Capstone Project

The purpose of Allmanos is to provide a resource for communities to serve one another. I used React state management to allow users to create an account, and create service requests.

Users can also use the Google Maps API to view what service requests are in the area and accept a request as a volunteer.

The web application was designed with Tailwind CSS
